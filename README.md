# ECG-Based-Biometrics-Identification
Biometrics is needed where security is essential. Biomedical signal processing aims at extracting significant information from biomedical signals the Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been used as a significant diagnostic tool for decades. The Physiological and Geometrical differences of the heart among individuals reveal certain uniqueness in their ECG signals In this project, we need to distinguish between three individuals using their ECG signals using SIGNAL PROCESSING METHOD as applying some Pre-Processing in signal such as REMOVING NOIS (Main Removal, Filtering, Normalization), EXTRACT Feature applying Auto-Correlation, DCT(Discrete Cosine Transform) THEN CLASSIFICATION using Machine-Learning technique SVM(Support Vector Machine) and KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier to Classify and Recognition the signal of the Three Individual
